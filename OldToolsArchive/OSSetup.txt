Mark,

None of the following will require a reboot...


1.  The first thing I would suggest you do is edit the /etc/inetd.conf file and
     comment out all services not required; which will probably be everything.
     Then stop and restart inetd:

         ps -ef | grep inetd  (FInd the PPID for inetd)
         kill -HUP <inetd PPID>

2.  To get DNS up and running:
      Edit the /etc/nsswitch.conf file; append "dns" to the line beginning with "hosts:"
      Create the /etc/resolv.conf; you can vi the file and then cut and paste from the
      /etc/resolv.conf file on tower if you'd like.

3.  Install ssh; at least the server version.
     You can ftp this down from tower: username: staging,  paswword:  (The old esb...  password)
     The file you'll want to get is in the /var/tmp/pkgs directory and called SENSsshs-1.3-sparc-5.5.1.tar.Z

      Simply uncompress it and untar it as follows, "zcat  SENSsshs-1.3-sparc-5.5.1.tar.Z | tar -xvf -"
      Then do a simple pkgadd to install it.  You may need to launch it after the install:  "/etc/init.d/sshd start"


Beyond this, it depends on how tight you want to lock it down.  Do you want to restrict access to
specific hosts?  Do you want a firewall installed and configured?

Oh yeah, did the /etc/defaultrouter get created?  If not, vi /etc/defaultrouter and add to it the
IP address 172.20.16.248
