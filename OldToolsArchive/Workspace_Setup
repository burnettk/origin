The command to set up a new 1.02 child workspace is
/usr/dist/share/devpro/5.x-sparc/bin/bringover -p
/net/gcs-source.central/isdev2/parent_ws/SAMS-1.02 -w YOURCHILDDIRECTORY .

where you replace YOURCHILDDIRECTORY with the path to where you want your
child directory to be.  After YOURCHILDDIRECTORY there is a space and then
a dot.  That dot is significant, and it needs to be separated from
YOURCHILDDIRECTORY by a space.

If this bringover command fails, it means that the host that you are logged
into doesn't have NFS access to /net/gcs-source.central/isdev2
You'll need to file a servicedesk ticket to get this access set up.
