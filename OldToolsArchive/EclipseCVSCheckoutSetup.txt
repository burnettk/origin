Setup for CVS Checkout and build/run procedures.

NOTE: When using ant build.xml files, even though the building may be done
by ant, Eclipse needs a parallel set of files for run/debug. This procedure
handles that.

1. New->Other->CVS->Checkout Projects from CVS
2. Enter CVS repository info, username, password, and be sure to use the
   option of the New Project Wizard. 
3. Click Finish and in the Select a Wizard 
   dialog, select Java Project. 
4. Click Next, then select the option Create seperate source and output folders.
   Click Next again.
5. In the Default output folder text field, enter a folder like "eclipse-classes"
   which will not be shown in the Navigator, but will hold the class files specifically
   for Eclipse build/run/debug. Click Finish and download of the CVS repository will happen.
6. Right click on the new project and Properties.
7. Click on the Source tab, and on any existing folders, click Remove.
8. Click Add Folder and select the needed folders for the source. These are ones like:
   	src/functional
   	src/java
   	src/test
	etc (for properties files or XML files)
9. Click on Java Build Path and Add JARs.
10. Open the "lib" folder and add all jars one by one in the sub-folders. Click OK.
11. Check to see that all red X flags are gone for the build. Add all jars/folders
    until flags are gone.
12. Make any changes to properties files that are needed and attempt to Run/Debug
13. There may be a "bin" folder created for Eclipse that is empty. Delete it.
14. Build the project using the ant build.xml file to create the build directory.
15. Refresh the project to display the build folder.
16. Add the build/etc folder to the classpath so that thing like log4j.xml can be found.
17. Select a .java file with a main() method and run to check the health.
