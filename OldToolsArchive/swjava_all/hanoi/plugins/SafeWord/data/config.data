# ROLE defines a user role, and its associated timeouts (in seconds).
# Timeout values may range from 0 to 604800 seconds (= 1 week).
# A timeout val of 0 will always cause failure (ie. disables that role.)
# enableTimeout is a boolean indicating whether to enforce that role's timeouts;
#               Legal values are "true" or "false" (case-insensitive.)
# "default" is the default rolename, and is required.
# You may define up to 49 additional roles.

# Format is as follows:       
#ROLE                    ;rolename,idleTimeout,sessionTimeout,enableTimeout

# credentials.  The domain name must start with a '.'.
