#              SafeWord Web Access for 1.2 SafeWord Configuration File
#  
#
#  This file determines several operating parameters for SafeWord Web Access.
#  It may be edited with any text editor. Values are case sensitive.
#
#  Lines beginning with a pound sign "#" are treated as comments (the "#"
#  MUST be the FIRST character on the line).
#
#  Each line in the file has two parts. Everything left of the colon ":" 
#  is the parameter "Descriptor".  The Descriptor MUST include a two character
#  ID such as "10" at the beginning of the line followed by a space.  The 
#  remaining text portion of the descriptor is not used and is
#  present only to make the line understandable for humans.  To the right
#  of the colon ":" is one or more actual "Parameter Values"
#  


# SafeWord Authentication Server                
#   This specifies one or more servers to use. There must at least one server
#   specified. Up to three additional servers may optionally be specifed.
#
#   Syntax:
#   02 SafeWord Authentication Server:   host  weight  connections  [port]
#
#   host - name or IP address where the SafeWord server is located
#             The host name may be one of the following:
#            (1. Host IP address (e.g. 200.2.2.27).
#             (2. Host name. An entry must be made in the /etc/hosts file
#            associating the IP address with the host name.
#
#   weight - value used for determining priority and load balancing
#           for multiple authentication servers.
#           The weight value determines which servers will be used under what
#          conditions. There are two schemes for selecting servers as they are
#          needed
#      1. Prioritized
#          This scheme specifies a primary server which is always used if
#          possible. If it goes down, then the second server on the list is used
#          as a backup. If it fails, the next is used and so forth. To specify this
#          scheme, set all the weights to 0. The priority is the order in which
#          the servers are entered in the file, the first entered has the highest
#          priority.
#      2. Load balancing
#          This scheme provides a way to distribute the client load across
#          multiple servers. As each session requires a server, a server is
#          selected in round robin fashion. For an equal balancing of all serv-ers,
#          enter a 1 for all servers. For unequal loading, simply increase
#          the weight to increase the load.
#
#  connections - the maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed.
#            Set this if you need to throttle swwa. This is typically set to 0 which
#            means no limit.
#
#  port -  service port or socket number of the server (optional)
#           The service port number of the service is optional. If ommited or
#           set to zero, the default port number will be used. Typically it is
#           not required. It should only need to be specified when the default
#           port number conflicts with an existing service.
#           When the port number is zero or not entered, then the swwa
#           client will look in the /etc/services file for an entry for 'safeword'.
#           The entry would look like this:
#                 safeword        7484/tcp            # SafeWord Authentication Server
#           If the entry is found, the specified number will be used. If no entry
#           is found, then the client will use the default number of 7482.
#
# Single server example:
#    02 SafeWord Authentication Server:     222.40.23.02 0 0 7479
#
# Multiple server example, primary with backups:
#    02 SafeWord Authentication Server:     222.40.23.02 0 0 7479
#    02 SafeWord Authentication Server:     222.40.23.02 0 0 7480
#    02 SafeWord Authentication Server:     222.40.23.04 0 0 7479
# 
# Multiple server example, load sharing:
#    02 SafeWord Authentication Server:     222.40.23.02 2 0 7479
#    02 SafeWord Authentication Server:     222.40.23.03 1 0 7479
#    02 SafeWord Authentication Server:     222.40.23.04 1 0 7479
