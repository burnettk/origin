In the below message, i have include the expected messages which will be sent to "1233444@skytel.com"
pager and how to handle them.Please, review and let me know if you have any questions.


***NOTE: This pager will beep if we have DSAME/Proxy problem and also DS/IDAR problem.If it is DSAME/Proxy problem we have to handle otherwise DS team will take care of it, just accept ticket and provide comments.

-----------------------------

1)If pager is message :

/////
  srvdesk@servicedeskdb.central.sun.com| Servicedesk
  Request 3026071 Paged | P-1
  Req from Ravishankar Govindarajan x 00000 sca20
  for SAMS Technical/Application..eBusiness Applications
///

 Resolution :

 1. Logon to CSSIT_AMS_DEV queue
 2. Accept the ticket with ticket no = REQUEST value from the
  above message.
 3. In the ticket, search for "Node" value. This has the SAMS
   machine name. If Node value is of the DSAME/Proxy(sams-fe3,sams-fe4,brm-sams-ext1,
   brm-sams-ext2) machine,
   then go to step 4. If not, this implies ticket is for
   DS/IDAR machine.So, the DS/IDAR team would have also received
   pager and they would have started working on it. So, in this
  case just accept the ticket and provide comments that "DS/IDAR
   dev team is working on this issue. Please, contact Venu Alla/Ravi G".

 4.  Check for "Instance" value in the ticket. If it is "PROXY" OR
    "DSAME", then u need to handle this ticket.So, go to step 5.
     Else, this implies ticket is for "IDAR". DS team will be
    handling it.Accept ticket and provide comments.


 5.
   5.a) If the "Instance" value is "DSAME", for resolution goto


http://gsoit.central/eforce/projects/IS/SAMS2/support/dsameTroubleshooting.html

     and check "SAMS Monitor alarm" section.

 NOTE: Most of the times, these alarms may be false due to network issues.

   5.b) If the "Instance" value is "Proxy", for resolution goto


http://gsoit.central/eforce/projects/IS/SAMS2/support/proxyTroubleshooting.html

     and check "SAMS Monitor alarm" section.

  1. If machines if sams-fe or sams-fe4 , go to http://gsoit.central/eforce/projects/IS/SAMS2/support/dsameTroubleshooting.html
      and check "SAMS Monitor alarms" section.

  2. Else if machine is brm-sams-ext1.sun.com and brm-sams-ext2.sun.com .Check the Monitor Name in the pager, it should
      be something like "PRODUCTION proxy...". If so, go to
