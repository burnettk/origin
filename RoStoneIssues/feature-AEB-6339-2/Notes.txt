As a Super Editor, I can create a new Version of a published lesson if no other unpublished version (aka "clone") exists for that lesson
Acceptance Criteria
For ALL ARIA Editor Tools (ie - AEB, SFH, SEU, and future ARIA products like Chickasaw):
If no "Pending" version exists for the Lesson, the "Versions" menu will display an "(plus) New Version" option.
If a "Pending" version exists for the Lesson, the Versions menu will NOT display the "(plus) New Version" option.
"(plus) New Version" is only displayed to Super Editors, as this functionality should only be allowed to Super Editors.
When the Super Editor clicks "(plus) New Version":
the new Version is defined as "Pending", and is now available in the Version Dropdown menu
the new Version is shown in the Authoring state
the new Version's state in the Display Listing View will be listed as "Draft" under state.
