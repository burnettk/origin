Question: When it comes to creating Quick Filters in the Jira Board, I seem to have a set already available. 
Do I customize this for myself, or leave it as one for the team?

	Swimlanes: Based on component, and who it's assigned to.

	Like Kanban but end dates are assigned; Sprint ends.
	Not actionable until new board?

Swimlane Orca:

	50K view: Mobile team and Web team: 
		Mobile client, Single solution, Unified solution
		English:  Take assessment test to place them in:
			Foundations, RSA, AEB

			Foundations: No experience ("sefer level") A1 or A2 ??

			Higher Level: Why do you want to learn this level?

			RSA or AEB

			RSA - Tell Me More, aquired by RS, with all languanges teach at higher levels
			Placing into B1, B2, C1

			AEB - I want to learn English because I want to work in business

Beta Version: Orca

	Web version of product: 
	Launch into a single Chrome: Client is the same with Web and Mobile
	Orca server is not real but a mockup; Still needs to be created.
	Orca server needs to be created.

Reach out to Eric where Orca testing can be done.

Moving stories:

	Move from one column to another is based on "Ready for QA" or "Ready for Release"

Bypass story movement:

	Open the story, Workflow -> In Test -> Ready for Release
	But usually just -> In Test if not availble by the board
