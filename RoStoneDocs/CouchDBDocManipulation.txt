If you look at the biblio relationship page: 

https://jira.trstone.com/wiki/display/CAL/Document+Relationships  

you can see that course translations have a semantic id that consists of 
'courseTranslation/<courseId>/<origLang>'. So, to determine the id for the 
course's course translation (in english) it would be: 

'courseTranslation/234f0730-2b23-4fa6-9b1e-08f55821e45b/en' 

if you just start typing 'courseTranslation/234f0...' into the search bar of 
futon it should come up with a list of all courseTranslations for that course.

So you can delete that courseTranslation document and it should run fine. 
However, it sounds like we have an issue in one of the testcases where it's not 
properly removing the courseTranslation after creating it. Could you look into this a 
bit and see if you can find out what the root cause is? If you can't quickly determine 
the reason, but want to get unblocked by this, let's open a new bug in the TTN project 
in jira that describes the issue, and then finally quarantine the offending testcase 
with the tag 'quarantine='<TTN BUG ID>', where <TTN BUG ID> is the id of the newly 
created TTN bug that was opened.
