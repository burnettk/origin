We do have some outstanding bugs on two biblio testcases that have been tagged 
as 'speed='slow''. Recently they've become even slower and so the bug is to 
investigate why. I would suggest filter out the slow tests, as well as the 
quarantined and archived tests.  To be able to filter out the tests that have speed=slow, 
it seems you have to use the '-A' flag instead of the '-a' flag for nosetests. 
It would look something like: 

nosetests -v ./test/biblio -A "acceptance and not quarantine and not archived and (speed != 'slow')"

MH: This works
