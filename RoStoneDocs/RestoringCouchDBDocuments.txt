So do you just copy and paste the document from one to the other?

More or less, but it's not exactly that simple. What you can do is copy the entire 
json from qa-2 and then on qa-1 click 'New Document'. That'll create a template 
with a filled in new guid it wants you to use, but you can just paste right over 
that. However, the version you copied will have '_rev' revision field that it 
won't like to you post, so you have to remove that field before you save.
